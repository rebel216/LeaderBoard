# Microverse Leaderboard

- The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved using external Leaderboard API service.

## How to build the leaderboard website

- For this application the priority is to create a working version of the leaderboard that preserves user input.

GUI of Weboage is based on wireframe :
![wireframe](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/raw/main/leaderboard/images/leaderboard_wireframe.png)

- It will connect to the Leaderboard API (as described in its documentation) in order to implement the actions behind the "Refresh" and "Submit" buttons.

- It will use async & await and add as much styling as possible in the given time.

- It is built as a part of Microverse Web Developer Course. ES6 and Webpack template was used in this project.
